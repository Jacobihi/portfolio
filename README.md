# Introduction

The develop branch of my repository is focused on some of the ambitions and in-progress work I have for my personal development.
As I finish a project I will move it to my main branch through a "release" process.

I recently learned about [Climate TRACE](https://climatetrace.org/) and was captivated by the use of big data sets and analysis for creating social good through accountability, transparency, and useful communication of information. I have not yet spent the time processing large amounts of high-velocity geospatial or sensor data, and I have been compelled to learn.

My ambition is to leverage my existing professional experiences in data and analytics and grow skills to contribute to socially high-impact projects, particularly as relates to combating the climate crisis.

I will be slowly migrating some existing code snippets and building out my examples. I will outline my plans for the next several months:

# Near-Term Plans

1. Demonstrate some python code for basic ELT/ETL
2. Demonstrate some thoughtful SQL 
3. Demonstrate visualization on GoodData Community, Tableau Public, and Looker. 

# Future Plans (works in progress)

1. Demonstrate a simple ELT pipeline using publicly available weather/climate data transformed with spark
2. Demonstrate a basic configuration of AWS EMR
3. Demonstrate a basic configuration of a transformation pipeline on GCP Dataflow
