Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
============================

To gain exposure to and experience with a variety of modern data architectures and solutions, I am planning to test out some pipelines
on GCP.

To date I have mostly read a lot and played around a bit.

Things I am planning to use in a pipeline:

* BigQuery (data storage, SQL tranformation)
* Dataflow (pipeline orchestration)
* Looker (data visualization)

Possible consideration

* use GoodData community on BigQuery
